# NeuroNinja
An affordable and user friendly serious game for upper-limb rehabilitation. 

The current code is mainly to test the game logic. The sensors being used are visible light sensors but the final version will use IR light sensors which may require a different calibration method in the code. Finally, the code is made for only two sensor inputs but the final version will have 4-5. 

The current version is FINAL_1 which is run through the Teensy 4
